## Explanation 
An MST problem. However a major **difference** between them is - in this problem, every ==vertex== and every edge comes with a cost. While in the setting of MST, only the edges are associated with the costs.

Solution is to create a single vertex with edges to each node. The weight of the edges is equal to the cost of creating a well. 

```python
# Write solution

```
